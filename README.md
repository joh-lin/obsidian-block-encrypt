# Obsidian Block Encrypt

This plugin adds the command "Insert encryption block". This block provides an interface to create an encrypted block of text.

The encrypted text is never written to the document in an unencrypted format and is only decrypted for the view.

Currently this is the only funtionality of this plugin, but more things might be added.

**Important: This plugin is not responsible for any harm caused to your vaults. It is NOT TESTED and could break any time.**
